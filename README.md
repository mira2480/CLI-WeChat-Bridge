# Claude Code / Codex WeChat Bridge

Bridge WeChat messages into a local interactive `codex`, `claude`, or persistent
`powershell.exe` session. The main workflow is:

```text
WeChat (iOS) -> WeChat ClawBot -> ilink API -> wechat-bridge
                                              |
                                              +--> codex
                                              +--> claude
                                              +--> powershell.exe
```

The bridge keeps one local session bridge alive and mirrors:

- WeChat messages -> local CLI stdin
- Local CLI output -> WeChat replies
- Approval prompts -> WeChat `/confirm` or `/deny`

Adapter behavior:

- `codex` keeps a visible interactive panel in the current terminal and sends only final assistant replies back to WeChat
- `claude` and `powershell.exe` still use persistent interactive terminal sessions

## Requirements

- Bun >= 1.0 for setup and tests
- Node.js >= 24 for the default bridge runtime
- A local CLI to bridge: `codex`, `claude`, or `powershell.exe`
- The latest iOS WeChat build with ClawBot support

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

2. Log in to WeChat and save bridge credentials:

```bash
bun run setup
```

Credentials are stored in `~/.claude/channels/wechat/account.json`.
The bridge uses `account.json.userId` as the only authorized WeChat owner.

3. Start a bridge:

```bash
bun run bridge:codex
# or
bun run bridge:claude
# or
bun run bridge:shell
```

4. After startup:

- Send plain text to forward input to the active CLI session
- Use `/status` to inspect the bridge
- Use `/stop` to send Ctrl+C
- Use `/reset` to restart the local session
- Use `/confirm <code>` or `/deny` for approval prompts
- No `/pair` step is required
- Only the logged-in WeChat account from `account.json.userId` is allowed to use the bridge

## Why Node Is The Default Bridge Runtime

On Windows, interactive `node-pty` sessions are more reliable under Node.js than
under Bun for `codex` and `claude`. The package scripts keep the same
`bun run bridge:*` user interface, but those scripts now launch Node directly:

```bash
node --no-warnings --experimental-strip-types wechat-bridge.ts --adapter codex
```

The bridge also resolves Windows launchers more carefully:

- `codex.ps1` is avoided because PowerShell execution policy often blocks it
- `codex.cmd` is wrapped through `cmd.exe` when needed
- bundled vendor `codex.exe` is preferred when available
- `claude.exe` is launched directly when present

For `codex`, the bridge also starts a private local app-server and connects the
visible TUI client to it. This keeps the terminal panel interactive while the
bridge extracts clean final replies for WeChat from the Codex session log.

## Scripts

```bash
bun run setup
bun run bridge:codex
bun run bridge:claude
bun run bridge:shell
bun run bridge:bun -- --adapter codex   # legacy Bun entrypoint for debugging
bun run start                           # legacy MCP server
bun run check                           # MCP status check
bun run test
```

## Files

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `wechat-bridge.ts` | Main WeChat <-> CLI bridge loop |
| `bridge-adapters.ts` | `codex` / `claude` / `shell` PTY adapters |
| `bridge-state.ts` | Owner lock, state file, and logs |
| `wechat-transport.ts` | ilink polling and send-message transport |
| `wechat-channel.ts` | Legacy MCP server |
| `setup.ts` | QR login flow and credential bootstrap |

## Notes

- The bridge is single-owner by design. The owner is `account.json.userId`.
- `shell` mode keeps a persistent PowerShell session and adds approval for risky commands.
- Approval detection for `codex` and `claude` is text-pattern based. Verify it once on your machine.
- `codex` shows its panel in the same terminal that launched `bun run bridge:codex`.
- WeChat intentionally does not receive raw Codex TUI frames, task summaries, or heartbeat spam.
- The current WeChat ClawBot path still depends on the official iOS client feature set.
